# Real-Time System Performance Monitoring and Reporting Tool

## Overview
This project is a Python-based tool for real-time system performance monitoring, focusing on CPU, memory, and network usage. It provides a visual representation of system metrics using Matplotlib and exports detailed performance data to a CSV file using Pandas.

## Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks CPU, memory, and network usage at defined intervals.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays system performance metrics in real-time using interactive charts.
- **CSV Report**: Exports performance data to a CSV file for further analysis and reporting.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `psutil` (for system performance metrics)
- `matplotlib` (for data visualization)
- `pandas` (for exporting data to CSV)

You can install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install psutil matplotlib pandas
